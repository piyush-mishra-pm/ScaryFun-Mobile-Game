## My Role: Coder, Game Designer and Artist.
- **Code**: 
  - Tech Stack used: **C# and Unity-Game-Engine**.
  - Used **SOLID** Clean-Coding principles to make an extensible system of environments and levels, enemy types, power ups. 
  - used Design Patterns (**Singleton, Observer, State, Command**) and learned to use **Object Pooling** to optimise on Garbage-Collection.
  - Uses UnityAds for **monetisation**.
  - Save and Load system.
- **Art**: Created all the 2d (UI screen art, image textures, VFX textures and 3d model textures using Photoshop and Krita) & 3d art assets (modelling, rigging, animating and texturing using Blender).
- **Game design**: Iteratively designed over 10 different levels spread over three different environments (Jungle, Caves, Castle) and over 15 kinds of unique enemies.
- **Sound**: Used FMOD Audio Engine and open-game-art sound assets to create an immersive audio experience. I did not create any sound files by myself, but used open music tracks and SFX.
